而最让我害怕的是，把鞭炮的火信点燃，将其闷在易拉罐里，然后，等啊，等着，一声闷响。易拉罐有时候会飞天，有时候会一无所终，有时候会裂开。鞭炮响了，而且在心里一直回响着，甚至郁结成心痛。满口满鼻子都是烟火味儿，缭绕不去。
 
观音山，就是这种闷响。就是这种坚韧的烟火味儿。并不锐利，但是，猝不及防，声息无边无际。凡是有感触的人，还会在未来的日子里常常记起。因为它如此地贴近生活，生存，生命本身。
 
看毕观音山，我对它的票房并不乐观，比起让子弹飞的飞扬跋扈，非诚勿扰的华丽表演，观音山平淡得像办公室的袋装茶，无非是生活，无非是生活铸就的命运。但我相信，喜欢观音山的人会很喜欢。人分两种，有痛感的，和无痛感的。痛感，无非是一种存在感的存在形式。
 
观音山，写出了人生的痛感。也写出来人之存在。
 
说道存在感，许多人把这部片视为青春片，在我看来并不是，这部有着纪录片一样朴实剧情的影片，已经超越了简单的“青春”，“迷惘”以及“在路上”。春节回家后返校的时候，我很想写一篇文章：小城姑娘。写我自己以及和我一起长大的但一直没有离开家乡的姐妹们。这部片里，南风就是小城姑娘的极致标本，是可以和贾樟柯的小武对照的人物。范冰冰的光鲜亮丽并未损伤南风这个形象，这是这部影片成功的基础。李玉在人物的塑造上，从《红颜》，到《苹果》，再到《观音山》，都将小城姑娘作为一种典型艺术形象精雕细刻，凶狠地把她们扔进粗糙的命运里，冷静地看她们头破血流，而又拼死挣扎。南风，实际上已经是比较温和的一个形象。受不了南风把酒瓶往头上砸，强吻街头太妹，为爱情卧轨，当着酒鬼爹的面狂饮三大瓶老白干之狠劲的，那是因为你们没有在小城呆过，没有被那种毫无希望的人生窒息过。你以为每年从全国各地，忍受着铁道部的恶狠狠盘剥的人们，奔赴一线大城市的年轻人，真的只是图一个温饱，错了，年轻人，他们图的是一个活法。这个活法，不是那么浅薄的消费场所，时髦衣物，繁华街景能囊括的，而是一种“可能”，就像几个年轻人接触到常姐这样的京剧团演员作为房东，也是一种充满新鲜空气的可能一样，因为他们看到了另一种活法，这种活法，和他们必须和街头混混短兵相接不一样，和为了生存与当地警匪恶霸博弈不一样，和为了赚钱必须忍受猥琐的揩油不一样。哪怕常姐每天6点起来吊嗓子，孤僻难懂，无法通融，他们仨依然不愿离去，因为常姐代表着他们向往的生活本身——安定，不用和生活短兵相接；有独立的精神世界，不为外界打扰。
 
这是南风们没有的，所以他们挑衅着常姐的世界，他们偷窥，他们保护着常姐。他们不自知地以激烈的方式进入常姐的生活，而不仅仅只是住客。还记得，南风们第一次进入常姐的楼房时，南风欣喜地说：咱们这算是住进京剧院了哈。进入常姐的房间，南风竟然连厕所和厨房都分不清楚。开出常姐的破车，三个年轻人欣喜地兜风时的快意淋漓。
 
在没见到常姐之前，南风的生活中狗血不断，以至于她都没有办法好好哭泣，好好去吹吹风，好好和自己爱的人拼死爱一场。南风，是一个生命力很强大的女孩子，那些极端的行为，放在小城的背景里，是非常自然的。在小城里，年轻人擂肥是很正常的。如果你不甘受辱，你怎么办？打群架互K？缺人！即使人齐了，没人家专业；报警？有用吗？如果这时候有一个很好的理由，为了朋友，你便有了足够强悍的勇气——我没有人，但是我有命；我打不过你，但我敢流血；我是女人，我不能等你们欺负我，那我只能欺负你的女人。为了帮肥皂夺回被擂肥的几百元钱，在一帮混混面前，南风把啤酒瓶砸向自己的头，疯狂地强吻其中的女混混，站在南风的处境中，你必须承认，此时此刻，此情此景，她做到了极致，还能有更加酣畅的行为吗？不能。
 
同样的，看到愿意和自己患难与共的男人与别的女人亲热，南风卧在铁轨上，一字一顿地问丁波：为什么，你和别人可以，和我就不可以。我喜欢这种表达。也很喜欢她看到丁波搂着别的女人时淡定的忧伤，丁波一定是爱她的。她很确信。她只是不明白，为什么他还可以对别人那样。丁波的父亲揭开了这个谜底：当年丁波的母亲病重时，丁波的父亲不是不管，而是偷偷地给人下跪求情借钱去了。“一个男人，连自己的女人都救不了，有什么用。”丁波的爸爸如是说。丁波是一样的逻辑，他是送啤酒外卖的，因为人长得帅，被女顾客屡屡揩油，在工作场所——酒吧里，他和女郎热吻。本来这和大城市里，白领们衣冠楚楚地应酬卖笑并无本质区别。为了帮南风还上无意伤到客人下部而遭索赔的两万元钱，丁波卖了赖以为生的摩托车，而卖啤酒的同时，逢场作戏兜售虚假情感，又怎能和南风说得清清楚楚。南风也不一定不懂得，她反抗的正是这种爱情中的“政治正确”；我一定要让你过得好，才能爱你。悲剧因此诞生。两个人的事，坚持“政治正确”的那个人总是无比正义，无比强势，无比不容辩驳。女性的情感，哪怕再伟大，在男性那里，从来都必须在现实里烫一烫。这一烫，情感就变成了支离破碎的情怀与情绪。而后者都是易逝的。“一个男人，只有拥有了很多时，才能爱自己爱的女人”只是拥有很多是多少，到了那时又是什么时候？无奈的是感情，它是一个脆弱的TIMING的过程，过了，就回不去了。因为那时那景，没有什么，比一个实际的拥抱，一个真实的吻，更来得实际，比物质更加坚硬。
 
南风，还有一个回不去的家乡，父亲是个酒鬼，喝醉了还会打老婆。南风回了家，对着躺在病床上的父亲泄愤；你不是要喝吗、我今天喝给你看。还是一样的逻辑，南风，在社会中，在男友，在父亲面前，她都是劣势，因为她善良。只是她不服输。除了伤自己，她拿什么反抗围绕着她的所有让人窒息的不自由？她是没有家的人。尽管她父母双全。那天，她无声无息地跑到常姐床上，躺在房东常姐的怀里时，两个孤独的女人相依为命的感觉，引起的情感共振，让人静默感动。
 
主要人物之间的和解，发生在观音山上的那次出游。南风和丁波终于释然地在一起，水漫过他们的脸庞，也许，许多人看到的是情欲。但是，我想，山中温泉的水，代表的应该是温暖。就像确信爱人睡在自己身旁的那种温暖。最好的情爱，是和温暖有关。欲望，只不过开关罢了。
 
常姐在这次出游中，消失在南风三个年轻人的视野里，这个儿子在地震中死去的中年母亲，一直脆弱得如一抷上好的青花瓷，从一开始，她就和南风们格格不入。为了训诫这帮吵闹的小青年，她会假装给肥皂看手相，然后恐吓他，她会把丁波的牛仔裤剪了做了报纸收纳袋。和解的第一步，是南风们揭开了她的破车的秘密。正如南风们把常姐当作窒息平淡生活中的一扇新窗口，常姐又何尝不是呢?常姐因无法排遣中年丧子丧夫的悲痛以及没有希望的孤独生活，而割腕时，血浸没了洗手间的水池。邻座的师姐说：这是最痛的一种自杀方式吧，对吧?我在黑暗中笑了，用力地向她点点头。其实，活着的人中谁又能知道答案呢？但是，我想，割腕是最平静的一种死法，常姐甚至把割腕的那只手，放到洗手池里，她不愿打扰到那三个小朋友，血流吧，让水冲走就好。但，这未尝不是一种冒险的尝试，她赌赢了，孩子们救了她。她用一种极端的方式，逼迫自己打开心门，接纳闯进来的年轻人，她和他们一起兜风，一起去迪厅跳舞，一起去爬山。
 
人不会永远孤独的，最终，她是跳崖，还是皈依，都不重要，她总能找到某种让她的精神安歇的方式。无生无死，一种和极致的孤独和解的姿态。
 
许多人对常姐儿子的死所带出的512地震片段，兴奋不已。因为某些众所周知的原因，观音山所在的都江堰，也是失子母亲最为集中的地方。甚至，本片的观音山，也包含有某种特殊的意涵，观音，民间常用来做送子祈祷的世俗化的神仙。其实，这种联想大可不必。对于丁波来说，妈妈的死，爸爸的再婚；对于南风来说，父亲的宿醉，母亲遭遇的家庭暴力，被勒索的2万元；对于肥皂来说，缺爱的家庭，被人盯梢擂肥的恐惧，这些都是他们生活中的大事。地震，它之所以是大事，是因为它和千千万万个家庭的悲伤联系在一起。那些失子母亲的哭泣，那些难以愈合的恐惧与孤独。李玉的电影里没有大事，有的是将生活中的每件事做到极致的小城人物。这种家常的、贴近地面的视角，反而拥有了无所不至、扫荡一切的直面生活的勇气。
 
观音，不代表宏大的情怀，也不代表抽象的信仰。它代表的是母亲这个终极的概念，是故乡这个无法放下的重担。丁波母亲的死，南风母亲的痛，肥皂母亲的缺失，都是他们和失去孩子的常姐相依为命的潜在脉络。母亲，是一种象征。是我们抵御粗糙人生的最后一个堡垒。在所有和母亲有关的痛当中，最令人伤痛的痛，是失去孩子的母亲的心痛。常姐无论是自杀还是皈依都是一种放下。这部影片的历史对接，是理解常姐的关键所在。常姐不只一个。
 
整部片子，快乐很少。所以，我理解李玉在常姐割腕自杀后安排的温暖的片段。但我个人其实不喜欢这种强颜欢笑。这会令人尴尬。该流泪就流泪吧。假如有南风们的哭，和常姐安慰他们的笑，或可更符合他们之间的对位关系。毕竟是，母亲和孩子的关系，也就是保护与被保护的关系。只要母亲活着，哪怕她流了再多的血，依然会是这样。这是情感逻辑。
 
篇末的瀑布，仿佛是一剂安慰剂，大有大浇块垒之感。
 
只是站在观音山上，俯瞰故乡的年轻人，是否真的释怀了生活？
 
观音，只有在中国，才是女相，是普渡众生的神仙母亲。在中国，观音等同于慈悲二字。尽管，这部片中的小城生活处处令人窒息，但也处处充满慈悲。每个出场的人物，都有慈悲的一面。就连欺负肥皂的女混混擂肥后扬长而去之时，还不忘鼓励肥皂说：只要你减肥成功，我就做你女朋友。
 
观音，也意味着一种精神上的归宿。
 
假如，母亲就是故乡本身；假如，我心安处是故乡，那么，谁的故乡不在观音山上？
 
也许常姐的无生无死，就是我等到的那声闷响。这样也好，以无所谓的决绝，与孤独和解，从此无所谓心痛。
 
 
注：四川省都江堰灵岩观音山风景区位于都江堰市区西北4公里处（二王庙旁），是集儒、释、道为一体的古刹名山。
